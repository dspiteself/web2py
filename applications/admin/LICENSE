While Gluon is GPL2 I also distribute it in closed source for Windows and Mac using py2exe and py2app. Will your license allow it? Will an ackowledgement and a link in the documentation suffice?

absolutely.

the license says "both [the] copyright notice and this permission
notice appear in supporting documentation" (where copyright notice
refers to the "Copyright (c) XXXX by YYYY" lines and "permission
notice" is the license itself), but it's sufficient to put this
information in a README file or some other related document that's
shipped with the code.  see e.g. Adobe's "third party software
notices" for Lightroom for an example:

hope this helps.
